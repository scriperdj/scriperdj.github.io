   Its that time of the year when I feel guilty for not achieving
any of the targets set this year and start listing down targets for next year with the same energy.
This website was one on my list for this year. Am just glad that I could scratch it out.

##### About this site

The idea of a personal site didn't strike to me until I came to know about [Jekyll][jekyll-link].
Its a simple static site generator and it doesn't require a hosting server. You just need to
shell out few bucks for domain name if atall you require and [github][git-pages] takes care of hosting. Ofcourse there are many services out there like wordpress, tumblr, etc which don't require you to set up hosting but whats fun in them for a developer. Jekyll is just great, you should try it if you are on the outlook for bulding a simple website without spending much.
